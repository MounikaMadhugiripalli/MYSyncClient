 Purpose:
   To synchronize contents of a folder from one system to another

 Source Code and components:
   MySyncServer : Server that runs on a particular port number and has the required folders requested by client and responds to client requests for a folder by transferring the folder and its contents.
  
   MySyncClient:  Client that requests contents of a folder from the server located at a specific IP address and serving on a port number

  How to run:
   Place MySyncServer.c code in a folder on a computer and compile it using the below command:
    
      cc MySyncServer.c -o MySyncServer.o

   Now run this server by specifying the port number using below command:
   
     ./MySyncServer.o 5000

   Place MySyncClient.c code in a folder on a computer and compile it using the below command:
    
      cc MySyncClient.c -o MySyncClient.o
   
   Now run this server by specifying the port number using below command:

     ./MySyncServer.o <foldername> <portnumber>
     Ex : ./MySyncServer.o docs 5000

(PS: beacuse i was using a single computer i specified the IP address with in the code )
